# Predicting Customer Adoption Propensity Using Spending Behaviour

A machine learning dashboard prototype that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to accept a credit card offer, built as a Final Year Project (FYP).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can support **targeted credit card offer marketing** by predicting customer response propensity. A bank marketing officer enters customer profile and campaign details into the dashboard and receives an **offer acceptance probability** along with a **marketing priority recommendation**.

The final selected model is a **Threshold-tuned Logistic Regression** trained on historical customer and campaign data. The dashboard loads the saved model for inference — it does not retrain the model at runtime.

---

## ⚠️ Scope Clarification

This dashboard is **NOT**:
- A credit approval system
- A creditworthiness assessment tool
- A loan eligibility predictor
- A fraud detection system
- A live banking deployment

It is **only** a prototype for **marketing response prediction** — predicting which customers are more likely to accept a credit card offer for targeted campaign support.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Credit Card Offer Acceptance Trends in Banking |
| **Records** | 18,000 customers |
| **Target variable** | `target` — whether a customer accepted the credit card offer (1 = Accepted, 0 = Not Accepted) |
| **Accepted offers** | 1,023 (~5.68%) |
| **Class imbalance** | Highly imbalanced — minority class handled with `class_weight='balanced'` |
| **Train/Test split** | 80% training / 20% testing |
| **Features** | Customer profile, banking relationship, financial behaviour, campaign details |

---

## 🤖 Final Selected Model

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Model** | Logistic Regression |
| **Configuration** | Threshold-tuned (threshold = 0.70), `class_weight='balanced'`, `max_iter=1000` |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.764 |
| **Recall (minority class)** | 0.42 |
| **F1-Score (minority class)** | 0.26 |
| **Accuracy** | 0.86 |
| **Why selected** | Highest ROC-AUC, strongest minority-class F1 after threshold tuning, interpretable |

## 🖥️ Dashboard Features

The dashboard has five tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Project summary, key metrics, simulated live analytics |
| **Prediction** | Enter customer and campaign inputs to get acceptance probability + marketing recommendation |
| **Data Insights** | Descriptive charts from the historical dataset (acceptance distributions, quarterly trends) |
| **Model Evaluation** | Model comparison table and performance charts (ROC-AUC, F1, Recall) |
| **About** | Dashboard purpose, limitations, intended users, dataset info |

## 🚀 Running Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/FYP_Project.git
cd FYP_Project
```

> Replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the dashboard

**From the repo root (recommended):**
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

**Or from the dashboard folder:**
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

## ☁️ Deployment — Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push this repository to GitHub (ensure `venv/` and `.venv/` are excluded via `.gitignore`).
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and connect your GitHub account.
3. Click **"New app"** and select:
   - **Repository:** your GitHub repo
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Main file path:** `dashboard/app.py`
4. Click **Deploy**. Streamlit Cloud will install packages from `requirements.txt` automatically.

> **Note:** The `models/saved_models/*.pkl` files and `data/processed/final_dataset.csv` must be committed to GitHub for the deployed app to function.

## ⚙️ Limitations

- **Prototype only:** Not intended for live production banking use.
- **Historical data:** Predictions reflect patterns from the training dataset and may not generalise to all future scenarios.
- **Imbalanced dataset:** The accepted class is a small minority; the model is optimised for recall at the cost of precision.
- **No real-time data:** The dashboard uses manual input and a saved model. It is not connected to live banking databases.
- **Academic context:** Developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP) research study.
