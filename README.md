# Predicting Customer Adoption Propensity Using Spending Behaviour

A machine learning dashboard prototype that predicts the likelihood of a bank customer accepting a credit card offer, built as a Final Year Project (FYP).

---


## 🌐 Live Dashboard

Access the deployed dashboard here:

[Customer Adoption Propensity Dashboard](https://customer-adoption-propensity.streamlit.app/)

No installation required — the dashboard can be accessed directly through the web browser.

This interactive dashboard allows users to:

* Predict customer credit card offer acceptance likelihood
* Explore customer and campaign insights
* Compare machine learning model performance
* Support targeted marketing decision-making

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can support **targeted credit card offer marketing** by predicting customer response propensity. A bank marketing officer enters customer profile and campaign details into the dashboard and receives an **offer acceptance probability** along with a **marketing priority recommendation**.

The final selected model is a **Threshold-tuned Logistic Regression** trained on historical customer and campaign data. The dashboard loads the saved model for inference — it does not retrain the model at runtime.

---

## ⚠️ Scope Clarification

This dashboard is **NOT**:
- A credit approval system
- A creditworthiness assessment tool
- A loan eligibility predictor
- A fraud detection system
- A live banking deployment

It is **only** a prototype for **marketing response prediction** — predicting which customers are more likely to accept a credit card offer for targeted campaign support.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Credit Card Offer Acceptance Trends in Banking |
| **Records** | 18,000 customers |
| **Target variable** | `target` — whether a customer accepted the credit card offer (1 = Accepted, 0 = Not Accepted) |
| **Accepted offers** | 1,023 (~5.68%) |
| **Class imbalance** | Highly imbalanced — minority class handled with `class_weight='balanced'` |
| **Train/Test split** | 80% training / 20% testing |
| **Features** | Customer profile, banking relationship, financial behaviour, campaign details |

---

## 🤖 Final Selected Model

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Model** | Logistic Regression |
| **Configuration** | Threshold-tuned (threshold = 0.70), `class_weight='balanced'`, `max_iter=1000` |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.764 |
| **Recall (minority class)** | 0.42 |
| **F1-Score (minority class)** | 0.26 |
| **Accuracy** | 0.86 |
| **Why selected** | Highest ROC-AUC, strongest minority-class F1 after threshold tuning, interpretable |

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Features

The dashboard has five tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Project summary, key metrics, simulated live analytics |
| **Prediction** | Enter customer and campaign inputs to get acceptance probability + marketing recommendation |
| **Data Insights** | Descriptive charts from the historical dataset (acceptance distributions, quarterly trends) |
| **Model Evaluation** | Model comparison table and performance charts (ROC-AUC, F1, Recall) |
| **About** | Dashboard purpose, limitations, intended users, dataset info |

## 🚀 Running Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joannajorise/customer-adoption-propensity-dashboard.git
cd customer-adoption-propensity-dashboard
```


### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash

## ⚙️ Limitations

- **Prototype only:** Not intended for live production banking use.
- **Historical data:** Predictions reflect patterns from the training dataset and may not generalise to all future scenarios.
- **Imbalanced dataset:** The accepted class is a small minority; the model is optimised for recall at the cost of precision.
- **No real-time data:** The dashboard uses manual input and a saved model. It is not connected to live banking databases.
- **Academic context:** Developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP) research study.
